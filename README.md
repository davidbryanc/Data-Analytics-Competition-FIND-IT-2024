# Predicting Customer Promotion Acceptance Using Machine Learning

## Description

This competition aims to develop a machine learning model to predict which promotion a customer will accept from a store's six promotional attempts. The dataset includes demographic, economic, family, shopping behavior, complaints, membership, and promotion participation information.

## Background

Understanding customers better can enhance marketing strategies, improve customer service, and increase profits. The dataset helps the store understand customer demographics, shopping behavior, and interactions.

## Task

Develop a machine learning model to predict the promotion acceptance for customers, aiding in more effective and efficient future promotional strategies.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the Macro F-Score. The Public Leaderboard shows evaluations on 30% of the test data, while the Private Leaderboard reveals the rest at the end of the competition.
